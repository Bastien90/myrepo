# Covid 19 Analysis and Forecast

The repository includes a detailed analysis and an attempt to forecast the confirmed Covid-19 cases. I added additional data from the world bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator?tab=featured) like GDP and population and data about government interventions (https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19).
 I used time series models and machine learning (direct & recursive models) for forecasting, they perform better than benchmark methods, but as pointed out by  R. Hyndman (https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-covid19/) the models are unlikely to perform very well and epidemiological might be more appropriate.
